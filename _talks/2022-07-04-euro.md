We study the feature-based newsvendor problem, in which a decision-maker has access to historical data with demand observations and exogenous features. In this setting, we investigate feature selection, aiming to derive sparse, explainable models with improved out-of-sample performance. Current methods utilize regularization, which penalizes the number of selected features or the norm of the solution vector. As an alternative, we introduce a novel bilevel program and present a MILP reformulation, which we solve to optimality with standard optimization solvers. Our experiments show that the method accurately recovers ground-truth features for instances with a few hundred samples, while other methods often require thousands of samples to obtain similar accuracy. Regarding out-of-sample generalization, we achieve improved or comparable cost performance.
