I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics ([MIT CTL](https://ctl.mit.edu/)), under the supervision of Matthias Winkenbach. My research focuses on data-driven optimization for supply chain management, transportation, and distributed inventory management.

I received my PhD in Operations Research and Management Science from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I was advised by [Prof. Maximilian Schiffer](https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/osm/team/maximilian-schiffer/). During my PhD, I was part of the DFG Research Training Group [Advanced Optimization in a Networked Economy (AdONE)](https://www.gs.tum.de/en/adone/start/). 

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://bsaraujo.github.io/files/CV-Breno_Serrano_de_Araujo.pdf).
